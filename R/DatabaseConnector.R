#' How to download and use JDBC drivers for the various data platforms.
#'
#' @description
#' Below are instructions for downloading JDBC drivers for the various data platforms. Once downloaded
#' use the `pathToDriver` argument in the [connect()] or [createConnectionDetails()]
#' functions to point to the driver. Alternatively, you can set the 'DATABASECONNECTOR_JAR_FOLDER' environmental
#' variable, for example in your .Renviron file (recommended).
#'
#' # SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, PDW, Snowflake, Spark, RedShift, Azure Synapse, BigQuery
#' 
#' Use the [downloadJdbcDrivers()] function to download these drivers from the OHDSI GitHub pages.
#'
#' # Netezza
#' 
#' Read the instructions
#' [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSULQD_7.2.1/com.ibm.nz.datacon.doc/t_datacon_setup_JDBC.html)
#' on how to obtain the Netezza JDBC driver.
#'
#' # Impala
#' 
#' Go to [Cloudera's site](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/connectors/impala/jdbc.html), pick
#' your OS version, and click "GET IT NOW!'. Register, and you should be able to download the driver.
#'
#' # SQLite
#' 
#' For SQLite we actually don't use a JDBC driver. Instead, we use the RSQLite package, which can be installed
#' using `install.packages("RSQLite")`.
