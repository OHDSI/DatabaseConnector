DatabaseConnector is part of [HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/).


Introduction
============

This R package provides function for connecting to various DBMSs. Together with the `SqlRender` package, the main goal of `DatabaseConnector` is to provide a uniform interface across database platforms: the same code should run and produce equivalent results, regardless of the database back end.

Features
========
- Create connections to the various database platforms:
  - MicrosoftSQL Server
  - Oracle
  - PostgresSql
  - Microsoft Parallel Data Warehouse (a.k.a. Analytics Platform System)
  - Amazon Redshift
  - Apache Impala
  - Google BigQuery
  - IBM Netezza
  - SQLite
  - Spark
  - InterSystems IRIS
- Statements for executing queries with 
  - Error reporting to file
  - Progress reporting
  - Multiple statements per query
- Support for fetching data to Andromeda objects
- Insert data frame to a database table
- Supports the `DBI` interface, with SQL statements automatically translated to the appropriate dialect.
- Supports the `dbplyr` interface.
- Integrates with RStudio's Connections tab


Examples
========

```r
connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(dbms="postgresql", 
                                             server="localhost",
                                             user="root",
                                             password="blah")
conn <- connect(connectionDetails)
querySql(conn,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM person")
disconnect(conn)
```


Technology
============

DatabaseConnector is an R package using Java's JDBC drivers and other DBI drivers. 


System Requirements
===================

Running the package requires R with the package rJava installed. Also requires Java 1.8 or higher.


Installation
============

1. See the instructions [here](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/rSetup.html) for configuring your R environment, including Java.

2. To install the latest stable version, install from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("DatabaseConnector")
```

3. Download the database drivers as described [here](http://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/articles/Connecting.html#obtaining-drivers).

4. (Optionally) To use Windows Authentication for SQL Server, download the authentication DDL file as described  [here](http://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/reference/connect.html#windows-authentication-for-sql-server-1).
