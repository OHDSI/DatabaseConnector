DatabaseConnector 5.0.3
=======================

Bugfixes:

1. Fixing 'DBMS not supported' error when connecting to Hive.

2. Fixing error when bulk uploading to Postgress with NULL values.


DatabaseConnector 5.0.2
=======================

Changes:

1. Updating Spark JDBC driver in response to Log4J vulnerability.

2. Using new Andromeda functions for better abstraction.

3. More informative error messages when user forgets to provide a connection property (like a password).

4. Also deprecating `oracleTempSchema` in DBI functions.

5. Adding `existsTable()` function.

6. Splitting vignette into two, because many users will only need to now how to connect to their database.

7. Improved error messaging related to the driver folder.

Bugfixes:

1. Fixing `getTableNames()` when the database or schema name contains escaped characters.


DatabaseConnector 5.0.1
=======================

Changes:

1. Added `dropEmulatedTempTables()` function.

Bugfixes:

1. Fixed R-Studio connection panel for BigQuery.


DatabaseConnector 5.0.0
=======================

Changes:

1. 32-bit integers are also converted to numeric by default because (a) the output of some SQL functions (e.g. DATEDIFF) is INT on some platforms, BIG_INT on others, and (b) dplyr often throws errors when working with both integer and numeric vectors.

2. Reusing byte buffer when passing 64-bit integers from Java to R for efficiency.

3. Adding support for connecting to Spark.

4. Adding `renderTranslateQueryApplyBatched()` function.

5. Throw informative error when provided `dbms` argument does not match any of the expected values.

6. Adding `getAvailableJavaHeapSpace()` function for debugging purposes.

Bugfixes: 

1. Fixing field type of numeric fields on Oracle when fetching data.

2. Fixing issues when fetching dates from SQLite (needed casting to numeric in some scenarios before conversion to date in R).

3. Fixing `insertTable()` when using a `databaseSchema` argument on SQLite.

4. Fixing `insertTable()` for inserting into temp table on RedShift when table name does not start with '#'.


DatabaseConnector 4.0.2
=======================

Bugfixes: 

1. Fixing handling of tibbles when inserting tables to avoid issues with date fields.


DatabaseConnector 4.0.1
=======================

Changes:

1. Using `SqlRender`'s new `tempEmulationSchema` argument. Avoids deprecation warning.

2. Throwing an informative error when the user points the `pathToDriver` argument to a file instead of a folder.


DatabaseConnector 4.0.0
=======================

Changes:

1. JDBC drivers are no longer pre-packaged in the `DatabaseConnectorJars` package. Instead, drivers need to be downloaded manually to a user-specified location in the local file system. The `downloadJdbcDrivers()` function has been added to make downing drivers easier. The path to the drivers can be set in the 'DATABASECONNECTOR_JAR_FOLDER' environmental variable.

2. Support for 64-bit integers using bit64's `integer64` type, although this is disabled by default because of the danger of silent errors when using `integer64` in R. Each query function has a `integer64AsNumeric` argument, and overall behavior can be set using`options(databaseConnectorInteger64AsNumeric = FALSE)`.

3. INT fields are now translated to R integers and back.

4. ConnectionDetails delays evaluation of sensitive arguments until needed for improved security.

5. Removing deprecated `schema` argument from `createConnectionDetails` and `connect`.

6. Deprecating `useMppBulkLoad` argument of `insertTable()` function in favor of `bulkLoad` argument.

7. Deprecating `oracleTempSchema` argument in various functions in favor of `tempEmulationSchema` argument, which can be set via the "sqlRenderTempEmulationSchema" option.

8. Adding bulk upload mode for PostgreSQL.

9. Batch mode in `executeSql` divides SQL into batches (1000 statements per batch) to avoid running our of Java heap memory.

10. Removed message that 'JDBC driver supports batch updates' when running executeSql in batch mode.

11. Added optional `databaseSchema` argument to `insertTable` for consistency with general OHDSI framework.


Bugfixes:

1. Fixed 'Warning: no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf' when a column only has NA values, or no values at all.

2. Fixed error when trying to insert data from a tibble.

3. Error report now includes all SQL in a batch when failing in batch mode.


DatabaseConnector 3.0.0
=======================

Changes:

1. Dropping support for orphaned ff package.

2. Adding support for Andromeda package to replace ff.

3. Error report file name now defaults to errorReportSql.txt to avoid confusion with other error reports.

4. Enforcing delay if about to exceed query quota on BigQuery.


DatabaseConnector 2.4.4
=======================

Changes:

1. Deprecating schema argument in connect and createConnectionDetails functions.

2. Checking table and column names for SQL reserved words when inserting a table.

3. Switching to Java 1.8 as minimum requirement.

4. Preparing for DatabaseConnectorJars v1.2.0, which will have JDBC v4.2 drivers (instead of JDBC v4).

Bugfixes:

1. Setting append = TRUE when not creating table in insertTable for RSQLite.

2. On RedShift, converting schema name to lowercase before getting table names to fix empty results.

3. Fixed insertTable on BigQuery.

4. Fixing autocommit not supported error on BigQuery.


DatabaseConnector 2.4.3
=======================

Changes:

1. Adding bulk upload for Hive.

Bugfixes:

2. Reducing batch size when performing CTAS hack on Hive to avoid error.


DatabaseConnector 2.4.2
=======================

Changes:

1. BigQuery insertTable now also uses CTAS hack for improved speed and avoiding insert size limitations.

2. Fixing null error when calling getSchemaNames for BigQuery.


DatabaseConnector 2.4.1
=======================

Changes:

1. Adding ability to set the path where the DLL is located for Windows Integrated Authentication for SQL Server and PDW.

Bugfixes:

1. No longer dropping '#' prefix for temp table names when inserting data for RedShift.

DatabaseConnector 2.4.0
=======================

Changes:

1. Adding runAsBatch argument to executeSql and renderTranslateExecuteSql functions to allow running as a batch (often faster).

Bugfixes:

1. Not adding '#' prefix when performing insert into RedShift.

2. Disabling autocommit when sending updates to RedShift to prevent errors with new JDBC driver.

3. Preventing 'FeatureNotSupportedError' from terminating query on platforms that do no support autocommit.

4. Fixing some errors related to insertTable when determining correct field type for columns.

DatabaseConnector 2.3.0
=======================

Changes:

1. Adding support for SQLite through RSQLite (mainly for demonstration and testing)

2. Adding convenience functions renderTranslateExecuteSql, renderTranslateQuerySql, and renderTranslateQuerySql.ffdf

3. Dropping Starschema BigQuery driver (in favor of newer Simba driver)

4. Added support for inserting BIGINTs (large integers stored as numeric in R)

5. Applying CTAS hack to improve insertion performance for RedShift (was already used for PDW)

Bugfixes:

1. Executing multi-statement SQL where one statement returns results no longer causes error.

Changes:

1. Updated to DBI specification 1.0
2. Defaulting connect arguments to NULL to prevent missing argument warnings in RStudio

Bugfixes:

1. Now generating unique display names for RStudio's Connections tab to prevent problems when opening two connections to the same server.

DatabaseConnector 2.1.2
=======================

Changes: initial submission to CRAN
